# gocv-playground

This repo contains various [gocv](https://gocv.io/) examples.

Many of these tutorials are heavily inspired by the awesome `Python OpenCV` tutorials you can find [here](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html).

I wanted to play around with `gocv` and had no place to start with that would show th usage of the package for various use cases, so I started hacking up stuff together for my reference; I figured it might be helpful to other fwllow gophers.
